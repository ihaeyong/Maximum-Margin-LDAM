'''
Properly implemented ResNet for CIFAR10 as described in paper [1].
The implementation and structure of this file is hugely influenced by [2]
which is implemented for ImageNet and doesn't have option A for identity.
Moreover, most of the implementations on the web is copy-paste from
torchvision's resnet and has wrong number of params.
Proper ResNet-s for CIFAR10 (for fair comparision and etc.) has following
number of layers and parameters:
name      | layers | params
ResNet20  |    20  | 0.27M
ResNet32  |    32  | 0.46M
ResNet44  |    44  | 0.66M
ResNet56  |    56  | 0.85M
ResNet110 |   110  |  1.7M
ResNet1202|  1202  | 19.4m
which this implementation indeed has.
